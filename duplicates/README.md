## Handling duplicate records in Oracle

Duplicate records are a frequent and often silent source of data quality problems.
They can distort metrics, inflate counts, and lead to incorrect conclusions.

This example shows:
- how duplicates can be detected
- how they can be audited
- and how they can optionally be removed in a controlled way

The emphasis is on safety, traceability, and understanding the problem
before applying any fix.
