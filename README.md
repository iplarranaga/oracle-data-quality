## Oracle Data Quality Examples

This repository contains practical examples of common data quality issues
found in Oracle-based systems.

The focus is on:
- making data issues explicit
- understanding their impact
- and applying controlled, test-oriented solutions

These examples are intended for learning and local experimentation.
They are not production-ready by default.
